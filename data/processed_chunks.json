The process \ncan be carried out by tilting the mixture after pouring out the top \nlayer. This process can also be used to separate two liquids that \ndo not mix with each other like cooking oil and water. When we \nleave the mixture of cooking oil and water, two separate layers \nare formed, where water at the bottom and oil, being lighter, at the \ntop. We can remove the oil layer from the top by pouring it into \nanother vessel, which leaves us with the water layer at the bottom.\nFigure 2.20: Separation of \nimmiscible liquids using separating \nfunnel\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website57\nGrade 7General  Science Student  Textbook another beaker.

When viewed together, these \nseven characteristics serve to define life.\n\u2022 Movement: An action by an organism or part of an organism \ncausing a change of position or place. Most single-celled creatures \nand animals move about as a whole. Fungi and plants may make \n     movements with parts of their bodies.\n\u2022  Respiration: The chemical reactions that break down nutrient \n     molecules in living cells to release energy for metabolism\n\u2022   Sensitivity:  The ability to detect or sense stimuli in the internal or\n  external environment and to make appropriate responses. Organisms \n  can respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can grow toward \n   a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or respond to touch. Even \n  tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals or light.\n\u2022 Growth: A permanent increase in size and dry m",

Make groups of five, and then categorize the following organisms\n    given in the following charts into some named group and present\n    the results of your discussion for the class.\nThe five kingdom system is the most common way of grouping \nliving things based on simple distinctive characteristics. The \nfive-kingdom system was developed by Robert H. Whittaker in 1969 \nand was built on the work of previous biologists such as Carolus \nLinnaeus. Living things can be classified into five major kingdoms: \n       \u2022  Kingdom Animalia\n       \u2022  Kingdom Plantae\n       \u2022  Kingdom Fungi\n       \u2022  Kingdom Protista\n       \u2022 ",

It contains a spring connected to a metal hook. The spring \nstretches when a force is applied to the hook. The bigger the force \napplied, the longer the spring stretches and the bigger the reading. \nThe unit of force is called the newton, and it has the symbol N. \n\u2022 Energy is the property of mater, and it comes in many forms, such \nas heat, sound, light, and motion.
